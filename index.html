            <h2>Calculator</h2>
            <p>The Calculator project is a fully functional application that I developed to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project was designed to enhance my understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as user input handling, conditional statements, loops, and modular programming in Python.

              Objectives
              Enhance programming skills: By building this calculator, I aimed to solidify my knowledge of HTML,CSS and Javascript to improve my problem-solving abilities.
              Create a practical tool: The goal was to develop a simple yet effective calculator that can be used for basic arithmetic calculations.
              Implement robust error handling: Ensuring the program handles invalid inputs and potential errors gracefully was a key focus.
              Features
              Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
